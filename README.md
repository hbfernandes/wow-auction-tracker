# Warcraft Corrupted BoE Notifier ![Run](https://github.com/hbfernandes/wow-auction-tracker/workflows/Run/badge.svg)
Notifies to a Discord channel if a BoE with specific conditions is for sale in specific realms.

This was put in place so I don't have to check the Auction House all the time in these dire Pay2Win times. Everything is pretty much hardcoded so feel free to fork to custom it for yourself.
